201600506 INIT WDS creating this readme to enable git to track this folder.
				Because git does not track empty folders.  This folder is referenced in the build.xml
				If this folder is not present then build.xml fails
				Therefore I am creating this readme to enable commit of the parent folder (src)
				Which is better than editing the build.xml and removing the referenced to src folder.
				** please delete this file as soon as there is valid java source in this folder.
